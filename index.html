        Tutorial packs are a way that we group the tutorials together, Tutorials 1-3 being in pack 1.<br>This was done to allow players to be able to play through each tutorial in which ever order they would like in each pack.<br><br>Players must complete all the tutorials in each pack in order to unlock the next pack.
